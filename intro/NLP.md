#  What is NLP?
- field of linguistics and machine learning focused on understanding human language.
- Aims to understand context, not just individual words.
- Includes tasks like sentiment analysis, text generation and speech recognition.

#### Common Tasks:
- **Classifying whole sentences:** Getting the sentiment of a review, detecting if an email is spam, determining if a sentence is grammatically correct or whether two sentences are logically related or not.

- **Classifying each word in a sentence:** Identifying the grammatical components of a sentence(noun,verb,adjective) or the named entities.

- **Generating text content:** Completing a prompt with auto-generated text, filling in the blanks in a text with masked words

- **Extracting an answer from a text:** Given a question and a context, extracting the answer to the question based on the information provided in the context.

- **Generating a new sentence from an input text:** Translating a text into another language, summarizing a text.

## LLMs

- A large language model is an AI model trained on massive amounts of text data that can uderstand and generate human-like text, recognise patterns in language, and perform a wide variety of language tasks without task-specific training.

###### Characterised by:
- **Scale:** They conatin millions, billions or even hundreds of billions of parameters
- **General Capabilities:** They can perform multiple taks without task-specific training
- **In-context learning:** They can learn from examples provided in the prompt
- **Emergent abilities:** As these models grow in size, they demonstrate capabilities that weren't explicitly programmed or anticipated.
---
###### Limitations:

- **Hallucinations**: they generate incorrect information confidently
- **Lack of true understanding:** They lack true understanding of the world and operate purely on statistical patterns
- **Bias**: They may reproduce biases present in their training data or inputs.
- **Context windows:** They have limited context windows.
- **Computational resources:** They require significant computational resources
